# Notes

- ROI (Return on Investment)
    - $ROI\ =\ \frac{Net\ Profit}{Total\ Investment}\ *\ 100$
    - To determine the net profit, calculate all of the cost savings that come from any of the improvement (ex. reduced downtime, improved equipment lifespan, and increased operational efficiency)
    - It is important to note that ROI calculations should also consider long-term benefits, strategic advantages, and qualitative factors that might not be captured in a short-term financial analysis. The company might decide to iterate on the project, improve the estimated values or explore additional data sources to enhance the predictive maintenance system over time. 
    
- Total Cost of Investment (TOCI)

- $Net\ Profit\ =\ Estimated\ Cost\ Savings\ -\ Total\ Investment$

- $ROI\ =\ \frac{Net\ Profit}{Total\ Cost}\ *\ 100$

- When the actual costs are greater than the estimates, the ROI value decreases... inversely proportional relationship
